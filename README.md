# SISA64-RISC

![sisa64-logo](docs/logo.png)

## Welcome to the world of simple computing.

This is the home of a work-in-progress 64 bit computer architecture that I am working on.

In this repository there is an emulator, macro-assembler, and documentation.



## Ultimate Credit.

This project is an answer to prayer.

I cannot take credit for the successes of the project.

All glory to Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, for ever. Amen.
